1. The program requires certain libraries, which were at the time of writing, not all available for the most recent python version. Hence when running the code, in addition to installing the libraries, it is important to look up the most recent common working version of python that supports all the libraries. 

2. List of abbreviations used in the Excel documents: 

avg - average
cta - call to action
num - number 

3. Due to the number of texts and the rhetoric devices checked, the code needs some time to finish running, this, depending on the machine running it, may take a few minutes

4. The comments of this code were created with the help of ChatGPT in order to facilitate the understanding for interested researchers by providing extensive coverage

5. All researchers and authors are encouraged to use this code and develop it further, hence unlimited usage rights are given for everybody, however for this to apply please cite this thesis as the original source
